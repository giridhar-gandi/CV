													This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how different ligands bind to amyloid fibrils (Aβ(1–42) and tau), revealing that ligands bind at specific sites with varying strengths and densities, influenced by their charges. The findings, validated by fluorescence experiments, show that binding interactions are governed by Coulombic forces in anionic ligands and Lennard-Jones forces in neutral or single positive charge ligands, offering insights for designing new ligands targeting these fibrils.
