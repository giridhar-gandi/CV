										<h3>Hello! My name is Yogesh.</h3>
									</header>

									<p>I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/panor"><b>Prof. Patrick Norman</b></a> at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, focusing on computational chemistry. My work involved developing advanced force fields for molecular dynamics simulations, automating parameterization processes, and analyzing large-scale simulation data, contributing to Alzheimer's research. I have substantial experience in machine learning, gained through internships and research roles. At IIT Bombay, I developed machine learning models to predict chemical reaction outcomes, employing neural networks and random forests for feature selection and model optimization. During my internship at Radboud University, Netherlands, I created a QSPR model using linear regression to predict binding affinities in host-guest systems.</p>

									<p>My expertise in computational modeling, data analysis, and machine learning equips me for roles in both academia and industry. I am driven to leverage my skills to innovate and solve complex problems, and I am open to opportunities across various sectors, including but not limited to pharmaceuticals, materials science, biotechnology, finance, healthcare, and technology.</p>

									<p>I am actively looking for job opportunities. I am interested in roles related to Machine Learning, Computational Chemistry, and Scientific Programming. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:todarwal@kth.se"><b>email</b></a> me if there are any roles for which I would be a good match!</p>

									<h3>Research</h3>
									<p>During my PhD research, I focused on gaining insights into protein-ligand systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and advanced computational techniques.</p>


									
									<p>In my recent work, I developed multiscale simulation strategies tailored for accurately describing small and medium-sized conjugated oligothiophene derivatives in complex protein environments. This involved utilizing fully atomistic MD and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to reveal the binding modes and photophysical properties of aggregate-specific ligands bound to distinct protein aggregate morphotypes. By combining these tools, we collaborated with leading experimentalists to establish an approach that governs the photophysical responses observed in emission spectroscopies, which are crucial for the experimental characterization of supramolecular protein–probe complexes.</p>

									<p>Through this research, we established a correlation between the binding configuration of aggregate-specific ligands and the aggregate structure, aiding in the understanding of the biophysical properties underlying aggregate polymorphism. Our MD simulations of protein–chromophore complexes allowed us to study the binding mechanisms and sites for anionic probes at the atomistic level, leading to new suggestions for molecules that could serve as early-stage detectors of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.</p>

									<p>This project was conducted in collaboration with the node at the Southern University of Denmark (SDU) under the leadership of Prof. Jacob Kongsted.</p>

											<p id="pubz"> <i> <b> Yogesh Todarwal </b> </i> </p>

											This dissertation focuses on refining force field parameters to enhance the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations, particularly for modeling small organic molecules and their interactions in neurodegenerative diseases and material development. These improvements enable more precise predictions of molecular behaviors and spectroscopic properties, facilitating early detection of diseases and the creation of advanced materials.

											<p id="pubz"> <i> <b> Yogesh Todarwal </b>, Camilla Gustafsson, Patrick Norman et. al. </i> </p>

											The bi-thiophene-vinylene-benzothiazole (bTVBT4) ligand, designed for detecting amyloid tau in Alzheimer’s disease, was studied using theoretical methods and experimental spectroscopies. This research confirmed that bTVBT4 binds to a specific site on the tau protein, a site not present in Pick's disease, which was supported by comparing theoretical and experimental data, including fluorescence imaging of brain tissues from patients.

											<p id="pubz"> <i>  <b> Yogesh Todarwal</b> Mathieu Linares, Patrick Norman  </i> </p>

											
													This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how different ligands bind to amyloid fibrils (Aβ(1–42) and tau), revealing that ligands bind at specific sites with varying strengths and densities, influenced by their charges. The findings, validated by fluorescence experiments, show that binding interactions are governed by Coulombic forces in anionic ligands and Lennard-Jones forces in neutral or single positive charge ligands, offering insights for designing new ligands targeting these fibrils.

											<p id="pubz"> <i>  Linnea Björk, Hamid Shirani, <b> Yogesh Todarwal</b> et. al.  </i> </p>

											This study explores the development of thiophene-based optical ligands, known as bi-thiophene-vinyl-benzothiazoles (bTVBTs), for detecting tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue. It was found that modifying these ligands with different heterocyclic motifs affects their ability to differentiate tau deposits from amyloid-β aggregates, crucial for AD diagnosis and treatment.

											This study investigates how transthyretin (TTR), a protein linked to amyloid diseases, binds to amyloid ligands based on the trans-stilbene scaffold. Using spectroscopic evidence, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics, the research reveals the preferred orientation of a specific fluorescent ligand (Py1SA) in binding site of the TTR, contributing to the understanding of TTR-ligand interactions and aiding in the development of diagnostic tools for amyloidosis.
