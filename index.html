										<h3>Hello! welcome to my webpage. Here you are going to find who I am professionally and what motivates me.</h3>
									</header>

									<p>For the past two years, I've dedicated myself to learning and working on a range of energy-related projects as part of my dual degree in Renewable Energy Engineering from EIT InnoEnergy and a diploma in Business Management and Entrepreneurship. Why did I invest such valuable time in this journey? What motivated me? If you're curious to learn more about my story, read on. If not, feel free to explore my project and professional details.</p>

									<p>I began with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, after which I worked as a project engineer in thermal power plant construction. My primary role involved overseeing the construction of a flue gas desulphurisation unit, designed to reduce sulfur oxides in exhaust gases. Working on this emission control project made me realize the critical importance of sustainability and the immense potential for future growth in emission control, decarbonization, and renewable energy solutions. This experience sparked my decision to pursue further on sustainable energy, decarbonization, and emission control solutions.</p>
									<p>This decision led me to learn from some of the worlds top-ranked institutions which are listed in the below Education section.
									<p>My expertise in energy system modeling, renewable technology integration, smart grids and data-driven analysis positions me well for impactful roles in the energy industry. With hands-on experience in computational tools like PyPSA, as well as proficiency in Python and machine learning applications, I am motivated to contribute to sustainable solutions that drive the energy transition. I am open to opportunities across diverse sectors, including but not limited to energy consulting, hydrogen economy, power systems, technology innovation, and sustainability-driven roles.</p>
									<p>I am actively looking for job opportunities. If there are any roles for which I would be a good match! Please feel free to <a href="mailto:giridhargandi18@gmail.com"><b>email</b></a> me. Thanks for your time!</p>

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<p>I have a blend of technical, industrial and business experience. During my Master's studies, in almost all courses, we had the opportunity to apply our knowledge through academic and industrial projects. 
										These hands-on experiences enhanced our understanding of key concepts and made us confident and competent enough to tackle real-life challenges in today's energy sector.</p>
									<h4>Master Thesis Project (In progress)</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>Investigating hydrogen integration pathways for the sector coupled German energy system:</strong>
											<p>I'm proud to be contributing to one of the most significant energy transitions of our time through my work on the H2CLIP project. 
												My thesis focuses on a crucial challenge of designing optimal hydrogen supply chains between Canada and Germany to support Germany's 
												ambitious climate goals.</p>
											<p>Using advanced energy system modeling, I'm analyzing how Germany can best integrate hydrogen into its existing energy infrastructure 
												across multiple sectors - from industrial applications to transportation and heating. My research evaluates various hydrogen carriers 
												and import options, comparing their economic viability against domestic production to create a comprehensive roadmap for Germany's hydrogen future.</p>
											<p>What makes this work exciting is its real-world impact. By aligning our models with actual utility and industry plans, we're developing practical
												 solutions that could shape how nations approach their energy transitions. The findings from this research will help inform policy decisions and 
												 infrastructure investments worth billions of euros.</p>
											<p>This project perfectly combines my background in mechanical engineering with my passion for sustainable energy solutions, allowing me to contribute 
												to one of the most pressing challenges of our time - the global energy transition.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Academic Projects</h4>
									<p>During my studies, I have worked on several academic projects that have honed my skills in energy system modeling, data analysis, and renewable 
										technology integration. Here are some of the key projects I've completed:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>:</strong>
											<p>As part of my coursework, I've used PyPSA, a Python-based energy system modeling tool, to analyze the integration of renewable energy sources 
												into the European electricity grid. By simulating different scenarios and optimizing energy flows, I've gained valuable insights into the 
												challenges and opportunities of transitioning to a sustainable energy system.</p>

											<p id="pubz"> <i> <b> Yogesh Todarwal </b>, Camilla Gustafsson, Patrick Norman et. al. </i> </p>

											The bi-thiophene-vinylene-benzothiazole (bTVBT4) ligand, designed for detecting amyloid tau in Alzheimer’s disease, was studied using theoretical methods and experimental spectroscopies. This research confirmed that bTVBT4 binds to a specific site on the tau protein, a site not present in Pick's disease, which was supported by comparing theoretical and experimental data, including fluorescence imaging of brain tissues from patients.

											<p id="pubz"> <i>  <b> Yogesh Todarwal</b> Mathieu Linares, Patrick Norman  </i> </p>

											
													This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how different ligands bind to amyloid fibrils (Aβ(1–42) and tau), revealing that ligands bind at specific sites with varying strengths and densities, influenced by their charges. The findings, validated by fluorescence experiments, show that binding interactions are governed by Coulombic forces in anionic ligands and Lennard-Jones forces in neutral or single positive charge ligands, offering insights for designing new ligands targeting these fibrils.

											<p id="pubz"> <i>  Linnea Björk, Hamid Shirani, <b> Yogesh Todarwal</b> et. al.  </i> </p>

											This study explores the development of thiophene-based optical ligands, known as bi-thiophene-vinyl-benzothiazoles (bTVBTs), for detecting tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue. It was found that modifying these ligands with different heterocyclic motifs affects their ability to differentiate tau deposits from amyloid-β aggregates, crucial for AD diagnosis and treatment.
